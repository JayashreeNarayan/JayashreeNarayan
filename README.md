### :woman_technologist: &nbsp;About Me :

I am a Physics Undergrad at IISER Mohali, India. I am currently enrolled in a BS-MS dual degree at IISER, meaning I graduated high school in 2020 and I graduate from IISER in 2025 with a Master's in Physics.

- ⌨️ I have had an interest in Computational Physics ever since I was 13. 
- ⚛️ I have done Computational work in fields like Astronomy (star and planet formation), Cosmology (traced the path of a photon around a black hole), Quantum Physics (to an introduction level), Material Science (found the resonating frequency of a GaAs crystal) and even a little bit of Quantum Field Theory (I learnt the MCMC method on a Field system), nanomaterial science and molecular dynamics (my thesis project).
- 🖊️ I dabble in poetry and writing often, do quite like it.
- 🔍 You can find me on Twitter and LinkedIn for more info!
