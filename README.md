### :woman_technologist: &nbsp;About Me :

I am a Physics Undergrad at IISER Mohali, India. I am currently enrolled in aBS-MS dual degree at IISER meaning I graduated high school in 2020 and I graduate in 2025 with a Master's in Physics.

- 👩‍💻 I have had an interest in Computational Physics ever since I was 13. 
- ⚛️ I have doen computational work in fields like astronomy (star and planet formation), cosmology (traced the path of a photon around a black hole), quantum physics (to an introduction level), material science (found the resonating frequency of a GaAs crystal) and even a little bit of Quantum Field Theory (I learnt the MCMC method on a Field system)
- 🖊️ I dabble in poetry and writing often, do quite like it.
- 🔍 You can find me on twitter and LinekdIn for more info!
